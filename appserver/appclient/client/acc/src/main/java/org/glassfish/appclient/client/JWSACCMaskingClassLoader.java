/**
 * Masks classes or resources that are listed in the "endorsed" packages that GlassFish provides.
 * <p>
 * During Java Web Start launches we cannot set java.endorsed.dirs to have the bootstrap class loader look in the
 * GlassFish-provided JARs for classes and resources that would otherwise be found in the system JARs (rt.jar for
 * example). We need some other way of making sure the GlassFish-provided JARs are used. Those JARs are listed in the
 * JNLP documents for the app, so the JNLPClassLoader which Java Web Start provides will find them if we give it a
 * chance.
 * <p>
 * This loader knows what packages are in the GlassFish-provided endorsed JARs and will report any matching class or
 * resource as not found. When an instance of this loader is inserted as the parent of the JNLPClassLoader then the
 * JNLPClassLoader will delegate to it first. The masking loader will report GlassFish-provided content as not found, so
 * the JNLPClassLoader will try to resolve them itself. That resolution will use the downloaded GlassFish JARs, thereby
 * making sure the Java Web Start launch uses the GlassFish-provided endorsed JARs instead of whatever happens to be in
 * the Java system JARs.
